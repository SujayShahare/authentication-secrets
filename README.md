# authentication-secrets
This web app allows users to anonymously share their secrets without having to provide any personal information. It was designed to be a fun and engaging platform for people to express themselves freely. The app uses the Passport.js library to handle authentication, and it supports both local authentication (using email and password) and Google OAuth 2.0 authentication.
